Traditionally, box office is the only standard to determine whether a movie is good or bad and
to analyze the development of the movie industry. On the other hand, movie ratings
have been popular on the Internet, and it is a novel and neoteric way to
investigate the others’ reviews and remarks before you go to the cinema. Can
movie ratings reflect the development of the whole movie industry and can the
people in the movie industry know which kind of movies the audiences like from
the information based on the ranks the audiences made?

Since
1890s, movies have been existing and affecting people’s lives. With the great development
of movie technology, a movie industry has been formed from silent motion
pictures. Nowadays, not only is there the largest “movie factory” – Hollywood
in America, but also there are other industries all over the world, such as
Bollywood. For a long time, box office has been regarded as a synonym for the
number of tickets sold or the amount of money raised by ticket sales, which can
be projected and analyzed for movies and the whole industry. However, there is
a newly-spread way to know about and analyze the movies – ranking the movies. Now
let us find out how the movie ratings can reflect the movie industry.

### Data Source and the tool

In order to investigate the relationship of movie ratings and movie industry, weuse the exploratory data analysis method, which is based on the database from MovieLens website ([Movielens](https://movielens.org/)). More than 24,000,000ratings and 670,000 tag applications applied to 40,000 movies by 260,000 usersconstitute our data base including tag genome data with 12 million relevancescores across 1,100 tags. From the dataset, we can get ratings of the moviesfrom 1874 to 2016, which are from 0 to 5. These data were created from January09, 1995 to October 17, 2016. Since the users were selected at random, it canbe representative. All selected users had rated at least one movie and eachuser was represented only by an id. Our data is more than 1 GB ([datafile](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest.zip)). Due to the large amount ofthe dataset, it becomes representative and meaningful to visualize movieratings and to analyze the movie industry.

Asfor the method of cleaning data, we firstly dropped the movies with fewernumber of ratings which are the movies with the average ratings of 5.0 andinfluence the analysis of the data. And then we separated the genres intodifferent rows. Because some movies are with more than one genres and thesegenres from the data source are kept in one row in the spreadsheet. At last weseparate the movie names and the released year, which are also kept in one row,and the reason is the same.

Thewhole data visualization and analysis is based on the usage of JupyterNotebook. This is a web application that allows the user to create and sharedocuments that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatorytext. And we can use this tool in data cleaning and transformation, numericalsimulation and statistical modeling. Therefore, we use this tool to completethe whole data visualization with usage of programming language – Python, whichis a high-level programming language and easy to use in data analysis.

Forexample, the picture above is showing the top 100-rankings movies each year.The color and the position of each circle represents the average rating and theranking of each movie. The scale of each circle represents the variance of therating of each movie, which stands for the degree of the controversy of each movie.From the picture, we can see there are more and more movies getting goodratings and the average ratings are getting higher and higher as the yearchanges.



### Ratings Reflect WhatKind of Genre of Movies Are Popular

In this dataset, every rated movie belongs to one or more than one genres.
According to the ratings of each genomes, we calculated the means of every
genres.

What can we know from the mean ratings of each genres? Let us explore the
information together. Each colored histogram shows a mean of genre. We can
easily find the highest one in the middle of the picture represents the
film-noir movie, which means people like film-noir movies more than other types
of movies because of the highest mean rating. Based on this theory, we can also
find people prefer to watch animation, crime, documentary, drama, IMAX and war
movies rather than other types. Among all the types, honor movies get the
lowest mean ratings generally because the scary plots and background music
cannot attract more audiences. As for other types, they get close averages of
ratings between the ones of film-noir type and honor type, which means they are
just normal types for the audiences. Hence, we can find out which genres of
movies could get a high rating on average and become popular since they are
released. Relatively, it could be known that honor movies may not earn the
public praise.



### Ratings Reflect the Distribution of the Qualities of Movies

Except extreme conditions, the ratings given by the users represent the popularity of
the movies but also reflect the qualities of the movies to some degree. Let us
take an instance, the movies with the high ratings of 4.5 are much better than
those with the ratings of 1.5 on the movie quality. Therefore, we classified
the average ratings into three kinds which are high quality, medium quality and
low quality. High quality movies are the movies with ratings from 4.0 to 5.0,
and medium quality movies are the movies with ratings from 2.0 to 4.0. The rest
movies with the ratings from 0.0 to 2.0 are the low quality movies. The graph
below shows the distribution of the ratings each year and reflects the
distribution of the qualities of the movies.
